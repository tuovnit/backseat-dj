# Backseat DJ

Backseat DJ is a mobile application built using React Native Expo. Backseat DJ allows you to connect with your friends to share a music queue and improve your music listening experience. Whether it's a road trip or a party, let your guests take control of the music by searching, adding, and voting on the songs you want to hear!
